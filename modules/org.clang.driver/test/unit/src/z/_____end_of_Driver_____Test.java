/**
 * Empty test.
 * 
 * JUnit tests runner reports twice about last test in last package in the module in case suite test was invoked.
 * Actually test runner runs last test in last package once.
 * See bug #257733
 * However double reported test results confuses developer.
 * This test is last test in last package and does nothing. Test runner reports it twice.
 * So the test added for developer peace of mind.
